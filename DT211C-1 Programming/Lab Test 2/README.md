# DT211C-1 Programming Lab Test 2

**Date:** Monday, December 5th, 2016 (3.30pm â€“ 4.30pm)

**Result:** 91/100

**Feedback:** 
>Brilliant work. Occasionally slightly circuitous route to the objective, but meets the technical requirements and satisfies the objectives fully. Some minor peculiarities of layout and the comments are slightly terse.

## Requirements:
Write a program that uses a 2-Dimensional array with 5 rows and 5 columns (i.e. 5 x 5).

Your program should do the following:

1. Initialise all elements in the array to contain the number 5
2. Set all the elements on the diagonals to be 0
3. Set all the elements on middle row and middle column to be 1
4. Set each element of the corners of the matrix to be 2
5. Count and display the number of times the numbers 0, 1, 2 and 5 are in your array.

**Reminder:** Use a symbolic name and loops where appropriate to access the elements in the array. Do NOT hardcode any element number of your array in your code.
