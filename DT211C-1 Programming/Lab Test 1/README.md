# DT211C-1 Programming Lab Test 1

**Date:** Monday, October 24th, 2016 (3.30pm â€“ 4.30pm)

**Result:** 83/100

**Feedback:** 
>Compiles and runs. Interesting solution which seems to work with test values, but may be vulnerable to floating point division errors for some values.better to use the modulus operator %
>
>Layout generally clear.  Comments very good.  Error handling accommodates negative values, but not non 4-digit numbers and other issues.

## Requirements:
Write a program that will allow a user to enter a 4-digit year and check whether or not
it is a leap year.

A leap year is defined as being any year that is evenly divisible by 4, except if it is
divisible by 100 and it is not divisible by 400.

Your program should display a message stating if the year entered is/is not a leap
year. 

For testing purposes, this year (2016) is a leap year.

Try to account for errors in input if possible.
